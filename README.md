# Che Chen's coding assignment
> The data used is : New York Police Department, 2014. "NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes". Time and location of NYC motor vehicle accidents. License: open data.
> [Data link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95 "Data link")

## Notes
- I have two data versions of `.csv` and `.zip` in my local data folder. Because the `.csv` version data is too large, only the compressed data can be uploaded to the github `data` folder. If you want to use it, please unzip in the `data` folder after downloading.
